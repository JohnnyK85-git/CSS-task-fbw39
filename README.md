# CSS-task-fbw39

Hi! The goal for this task is for you to practice the knowledge about css that you have acquired during the course. From this repository you obtain some images and .html files. With these as a starting point, you should add some code to the `style.css` file so it looks like the images in the next sections.

The context for this task is an hotel site. Here the users can see a home page to welcome them to the site, also they can see information about the hotel and a contact form so if needed they can send a message. Then there are 3 files for our app: 
- **index.html** is basically our home page
- **about.html** is our about page
- **contact.html** is the contact page for the hotel. 

Now here will be the images for each page for you to follow and try to replicate.

## index.html
![Index 1](/img/readme/index1.png)
![Index 2](/img/readme/index2.png)

## about.html
![About](/img/readme/about.png)

## contact.html
![Contact](/img/readme/contact.png)
